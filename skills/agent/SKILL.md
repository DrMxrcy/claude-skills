  Cost-tiered subagent orchestration for Claude Code (and other agents that load

  delegates labor to the cheapest capable model tier — implementation (executor),
  adversarial verification (verifier), security work (security-executor), mechanical
  edits (mech-executor), and read-only evidence (scout / Explore). Installs a fleet of
  project subagents plus an orchestration policy that merges into CLAUDE.md. Triggers

  this work", "keep the main model on judgment".

# Agent — cost-tiered orchestration

**Mission:** keep the expensive frontier model doing judgment, not labor. The main
session (the orchestrator) decides WHAT and delegates any evidence-checkable work to
the cheapest tier that can do it well, then verifies with fresh context before it
answers. Policy is written in **role terms, never model names**, so it survives model
version changes.

## The fleet (project subagents)

| Agent | Model | Effort | Use for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `executor` | opus | high | Implementation needing judgment — features, bug fixes, design-sensitive refactors |
| `verifier` | opus | medium | Fresh-context **adversarial** verification — CONFIRMED / REFUTED / PARTIAL, never fixes |
| `security-executor` | opus | high | ALL security-sensitive work — auth, secrets, headers, crypto, CVE triage |
| `mech-executor` | sonnet | low | Fully-specified mechanical work — pattern refactors, tests, docs, bulk edits |
| `scout` | haiku | low | Cheap read-only evidence — where/how is X, usages, config values, log summaries |
| `Explore` | haiku | low | Broad read-only codebase exploration (overrides the built-in Explore, which since Claude Code v2.1.198 inherits the parent model instead of defaulting to haiku) |

Every agent pins **both** `model:` and `effort:` in frontmatter. Subagents inherit the
main session's model *and* effort level when unset — an unlabeled agent silently runs at
frontier price. Frontmatter is the only reliable per-role effort control (the Agent tool
has no runtime effort parameter), and the fleet keeps the orchestrator free to run at
low/medium effort by default, going high only for multi-step judgment.

The full orchestration policy — who keeps what, one-shot delegation specs, the
escalation rule, high-risk routing, and the final verification gate — is the CLAUDE.md
block in `references/orchestration-policy.md`. The installer merges that block into
your project (or global) CLAUDE.md and copies the fleet into `<agent-dir>/agents/`.

## Install

From the repo root (or piped from GitHub with `curl … | bash`):

    ./install.sh                 # this project: fleet → ./.claude/agents, policy → ./CLAUDE.md
    ./install.sh --global        # all projects: fleet → ~/.claude/agents
    ./install.sh --no-agent      # skip the fleet entirely
    ./install.sh --no-model      # don't touch settings.json model
    ./install.sh --no-claude-md  # don't merge the policy into CLAUDE.md

The policy merge is **idempotent and additive** — it updates a marked block
(`<!-- agent:orchestration:start -->` … `<!-- agent:orchestration:end -->`) in place
and never rewrites the rest of your CLAUDE.md. Re-running upgrades the block in place;
deleting the two markers (and the text between them) removes it. Run the installer
once per project you want the fleet in.

The model wiring is non-destructive: it sets `model` / `fallbackModel` in
settings.json **only when you have no `model` set**, so an explicit model choice is
never overridden.

## Optional accelerators (auto-detected, opt-in by installation)

The policy layers two third-party tools **when — and only when — the user has installed
them**; their presence is the opt-in, and the orchestrator never suggests installing
them mid-task:

- **caveman** ([juliusbrussee/caveman](https://github.com/juliusbrussee/caveman)) —
  token-compression plugin. **Skills and levels only:** the integration uses the
  plugin's skills, `/caveman` levels (`lite`/`full`/`ultra`/`wenyan`), and `cavecrew-*`
  agents — the standalone npm tools (`caveman-code`, `caveman-shrink`) are out of
  scope. When the plugin is in the session, the orchestrator decides the level
  **during session orientation** — if the user hasn't set one explicitly, it chooses
  and sets one up front by session shape — `ultra` for orchestration-heavy sessions
  (multi-agent build chains, `--auto` runs, bulk sweeps), `full` for ordinary mixed
  work, `lite` when the user reads agent reports directly; the plugin's own session
  default doesn't count as decided and asks for caveman-terse reports (fragments, zero
  filler; code,
  commands, paths, and errors kept verbatim), and `cavecrew-*` agents may take
  scout-tier work. Compression is for prose reports only — artifacts, diffs, and
  errors are never compressed. Note caveman's own honest-numbers caveat: it shrinks
  *output* tokens, so the win is largest on chatty report-heavy delegation.
  The installer wires a **SessionStart hook** (`hooks/caveman-level.sh`). If the
  project pins a level in **`.claude/caveman-level`** (one word: `lite`/`full`/
  `ultra`/`wenyan`), the hook sets it outright at session start — writes the plugin's
  flag file and mode log, announces it as already active; nobody types anything.
  Without a preference file, it injects the decision prompt so the orchestrator
  chooses by session shape and persists the choice. Note the plugin's flag is
  global (`~/.claude/.caveman-active`), so the level follows whichever project
  started a session most recently. The hook no-ops when the plugin is absent; skip
  it with `--no-hook`.
- **codegraph** — code-index MCP. When the project has a `.codegraph/` index, evidence
  tiers (scout / Explore / verifier) resolve structure questions — usages, callers,
  impact, dependencies — via codegraph queries before any broad grep. Indexing is never
  run by the orchestrator; that's the user's decision.

## Important: agents register only in NEW sessions

Subagents defined or renamed are picked up on the **next** session start, not the
current one. If a named tier (`executor`, `scout`, …) isn't in the available-agents
list yet, dispatch `general-purpose` with the matching `model` override
(`opus` / `sonnet` / `haiku`) and the same one-shot brief — same result, no waiting for
a restart. Always use model **aliases**, never pinned model IDs (pinned IDs hard-error
when versions rotate).
